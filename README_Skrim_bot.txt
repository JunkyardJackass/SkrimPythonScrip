Skrim Bot ReadMe.

I am building a suite of stupid scripts to make MY playing of the game better. These scripts are designed to help ME, not you.
These scripts are also being built to build my coding capability, but I am very unlikely to be able to implement stuff. 
This is a test of what I can do, not what I should, or worse, what YOU can do.
If this or any portion of these scripts can help you, steal it or part of it, I don't care.



*** ENCHANTING ***


NOTE:   Enchanting weapons requires the user to hit E twice (to adjust the calibre of the enchant), 
        if you would like this function added, you need to swap the commented sections as needed.
        Swap the comments to activate and deactivate the set up as needed.

DO NOT RUN THE SCRIPT YET!

Open enchanting screen in game.

Empty non consumables from inventory that you don't want used for the process.
    The macro does not care about your items, Dump entire inventory except what is used for enchanting... 
   
Start the enchanter

Set up, but do not actually enchant anything. 
    Run the process but do not start it.
    Set WHAT enchant you want applied to the items by selecting it at least once, and then UNAPPLY the selection.
    (I cant prove it, but enchants which make better value for item SHOULD make your more XP)
    ENSURE no selections are made and hover over the ITEMS line.  
  
Launch the macro, this script, left click into the game again.

Process should auto burn any consumables for the process that are in your inventory.

Press U to shut the secquence down, or if thats not working because im a lunatic, close the program.


*** SPAM "E" ***
#This portion of the script is untested, I don't know if it works, and don't have the time to test it properly.

As (THEORETICALLY) set up, press F3, pressing it down should begin spamming the E key really fast.

Release F3 to stop spamming.

For best results reprogram a mouse key to use the F3 key, changing the script to allow it to use any other key is also acceptable. Use w/e you want.
